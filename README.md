üè¶ Loan Approval Analysis (LOAN APPROVAL ANALYSIS(2).ipynb)
Objective: Analyze historical loan application data and build a model to predict whether a loan should be approved.

Techniques Used:

Data preprocessing & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Handling missing values and encoding categorical features

Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest models

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Outcome: Developed a model with optimized accuracy to help automate the loan approval process.
